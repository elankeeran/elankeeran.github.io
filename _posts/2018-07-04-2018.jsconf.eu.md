It was a great conference and had a lot to offer! It is my first EU JSConf, and even though I followed the event on the YouTube every year, it matched my expectations and then some.
 
Due to my travel disruptions, I missed the Keynote session and other morning sessions of the first day but I attended all the other sessions.
 
The evening sessions of the first day were two teams called Nested Loops and {Live: js} and they had some impressive live Chrome Browser WebGL visuals along with WebAudio, find the experience here. https://youtu.be/2qXi816wMWA
 
At the high level, the conference was divided into two tracks: the BackTrack and the Side Track. This made the talks well focused. The attendance in both the tracks was at par. I visited most of the sessions from BackTrack as it covered core node.js technology.
 
There were great presentations (Find the list here: https://2018.jsconf.eu/speakers/), it was evident that the people who presented had put commendable work into their projects.
 
As I reached the conference, the entire place was abuzz with people talking about the Charlie Gerard's talk - “Brain controlled JavaScript”. She had worked on a project utilising EKG supplementing human computer interaction. The technology is in infancy and can be challenging to figure out. She had made a C++ binding and a working demo using a brain sensor. Watch the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KhFO-qCVyg
 
It was an experience of a lifetime to meet and interact with the people who participate in TC39 (These people build the future of JavaScript!)
 
It was humbling to watch Ryan Dahl talk about Node.js and his “regrets” about the shortcomings of Node.js, I extended my appreciation to him for the same. It was a great talk, with a lot of technical references. He delivered it with elegance even after being nervous while talking to such a large audience. He said he loved 'Go' language and 'Typescript'. He also showcased his latest project: “Deno” - A secure TypeScript runtime on V8. He encouraged the community to contribute for the same.

I personally shared my journey with node.js and my experiences of last seven years with Ryan Dahl. I took a photo with him. I'll never forgot that moment in my life.
 
Mathias Bynens & Benedikt Meurer gave a deep information talk on JavaScript Engines: The Good Parts. The talk was a comparison among the JavaScript engines and their salient features. Find the talk here: https://youtu.be/5nmpokoRaZI
 
The sponsor and community area were innovative, Mozilla had put up an impressive interactive LED wall using Rust language where people could make their colourful animations and submit them[https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/06/babys-first-rustwebassembly-module-say-hi-to-jsconf-eu/].
 
I also attended the Rust “Hello world” workshop. This motivated me to take my a new learning journey in Rust.js.
 
There was a great Demo and hands on workshop IoT node.js microcontroller with wifi. Everyone was given their individual microcontroller to play around with.

The community lounge was a great place, there were exciting talks and friendly people. Andrès Cuervo had an impressive WebVR art installation made with Aframe that people could try. The idea was to collect everybody's movements and combine them at the end!
